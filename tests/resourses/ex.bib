The KEY field is here to override the KEY field in the journal being
cross referenced (so is the NOTE field, in addition to its imparting
information).

@ARTICLE{article-crossref,
   crossref = "WHOLE-JOURNAL",
   key = "",
   author = "Leslie A. Aamport",
   title = "The Gnats and Gnus main.Document Preparation System",
   pages = "73+",
   note = "This is a cross-referencing ARTICLE entry",
}
